This controller typically consists of a linear time-invariant compensator together with a tuning mechanism which adjusts the controller gains; typical control objectives are stabilization and tracking.The bulk of the course will be centered on an identifier based approach. Here one chooses a model for the plant, whose parameters are unknown, and the plant parameters are recursively estimated; controller gains are computed assuming that the present estimate is corrent.
